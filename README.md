# Data Science Project Portfolio

## Project 1 - Stock market prediction
The challenge of the stock price forecast is the most crucial component for companies and equity traders to predict future revenues. A successful and accurate prediction of future stock prices ultimately results in profit maximization. 
The stock market is one of the major fields that investors are dedicated to, thus stock market price trend prediction is always a hot topic for researchers from both financial and technical domains. In this research, our objective is to build a state-of-art prediction model for price trend prediction, which focuses on short-term price trend prediction.

## Project 2 - COVID-19 Visualization & Prediction
Coronavirus is a family of viruses that are named after their spiky crown. 
This project aims at exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and projections. We can use models like Support Vector Machine, Polynomial Regression and Bayesian Ridge Regression to predict the values.

## Project 3 - Credit Card Fraud Prediction
Credit card fraud happens in different ways, the new technology on contactless payment on the card allows anyone to read the card details with a contactless card reader. Also, when consumers give their credit card details to unfamiliar individuals when a card is lost or stolen. Many techniques have been introduced to detect fraud in credit card transactions. Fraudsters around the world are always looking for new ways to commit fraud. One of the challenges behind fraud detection is that frauds are far less common as compared to legal transactions. With the increasing number of credit card frauds in the financial sector, we are planning to work on this topic for our project. We found the dataset on Kaggle which is being used to build and train our model. As part of this project, we are developing a few models using anonymized credit card transaction data.
